# Tic-Tac-and-Toe
This Python code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. It alternates turns, checks for a win after each move by evaluating possible winning combinations, and detects draws if the board is full with no winner. The game validates user input, ensuring moves are within range and unoccupied.
